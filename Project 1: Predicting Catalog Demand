 Project 1: Predicting Catalog Demand
Step 1: Business and Data Understanding
Key Decisions:
Answer these questions
 
1.	What decisions needs to be made?

The decision to be made for sending catalog to 250 customers. If the predicted profit from this action greater than $ 10,000 then we should send catalog.  

2.	What data is needed to inform those decisions?

Sales data, number of products purchased, customers segments.  
 
Step 2: Analysis, Modeling, and Validation

1.	How and why did you select the predictor variables in your model? 

I ran linear regression study across most/all variables against Avg_Sale_Amount to see which variables are likely related to the Average Sale Amount and have linear relationship. As shown in figure no.1 we can see Customer_Segment & Avg_Num_Products_Purchased have statistical significance which mean that the results did not occur randomly.

Moreover, scatterplots are made for better understanding of the chosen predictor variables.
